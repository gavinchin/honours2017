# Modelling the City of Melbourne Pedestrian Data
## Thesis Proposal

# Introduction

The City of Melbourne has an Open Data Platform which makes council data available to the public  

This project will focus on the pedestrian sensor data

## How is the data collected?

The City of Melbourne has 43 sensors installed around Melbourne's CBD  
- These sensors are positioned under an awning or street pole, and count the number of people passing each hour
- The data is available as a `.csv` at https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/, and is updated monthly

# Why do we want to model pedestrian traffic?

### Being able to predict how many people pass through a certain location can be used by the government sector as well as the private sector  

#### Different ways it can be used: 

  Government example uses:  
    - Infrastructure planning
    - Security planning
  Private example uses:
    - Marketing campaign planning
    - Resource management
    - Investment planning
  
  and many other various ways..

## Time series at each sensor location




&lt;img src="proposal_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

#### Basic variables available are: time and date, sensor ID and hourly counts


```
## # A tibble: 1 Ã— 12
##      ID         Date_Time   Year  Month Mdate    Day   Time Sensor_ID
##   &lt;int&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1 01-JUN-2009 00:00   2009   June     1 Monday      0         4
## # ... with 4 more variables: Sensor_Name &lt;chr&gt;, Hourly_Counts &lt;int&gt;,
## #   Lat &lt;dbl&gt;, Lon &lt;dbl&gt;
```

## Multiple seasonal patterns

#### For example, at Flagstaff Station, we notice a couple of key patterns:
- Weekly cycle
&lt;img src="proposal_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Daily sub-cycle
&lt;img src="proposal_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Methodology

### The project has been split into multiple steps:  
#### Data Cleaning
#### Modelling
#### Visualisation
#### Shiny app development

# Data Cleaning: Problems in the data

### While the data variables themselves are relatively tidy, there is a large number of observations we need to impute:


&lt;img src="proposal_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Data Cleaning: Imputing the missings

#### A simple way to impute these missings is estimating a Poisson regression using GLM in R:


```r
missing_glm &lt;- glm(Hourly_Counts ~ Year * HDay * Time + Month,
                   data = ped_df, family = "poisson")
```

This can be expressed as:

`$$\text{HourlyCounts} \sim\text{Year}\times\text{HDay}\times\text{Time}+\text{Month}$$`
`$$\Rightarrow\qquad \log{\lambda_{i}}  =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\text{Year}\times\text{HDay}\times\text{Time}+\beta_{2}\text{Month}$$`
`$$\text{HourlyCounts}_{i}  =\text{Poisson}\left(\lambda_{i}\right)$$`

--

- This model specification implies an interaction effect between the year, time of the day, and day of the week (or if the day is a public holiday)
  + Month of the year is modelled as an additive effect 

- The model needs to be estimated for each location, due to the different characteristics between locations

---

# Modelling

- Main purpose of the model is to forecast pedestrian counts
- Data used for estimatation (training dataset) will be the period between 2014-2016
  + The data before 2014 is not stable, and also lacks data from newly installed sensors
- Data used to evaluate the forecasting performance will be the 2017 data available

- Due to the multiple seasonal patterns in the time series, typical models like AR, ARMA and ARIMA do not work very well
  + Modelling using other sources of data is being explored, in particular weather data
  + Alternative models, such as a Multiple Seasonal (MS) process available through the `forecast` R package, should also be investigated
  + Machine learning techniques, such as clustering and other non-parametric estimation methods, will also be considered

## Modelling: evaluating model performance
The criteria we will use to evaluate the model's forecasting performance is the root mean square forecast error:
$$ \text{RMSFE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=T+1}^{T+k}(\hat{y_t} - y_t)^2}{k}}$$
where the model is estimated with `\(T\)` observations, and we have `\(k\)` points to forecast (so we need to have `\(T+k\)` observations available)
- evaluating performance of the model on its forecasting accuracy is important, as it will reveal overfitting of data

## Visualisation: Currently available
#### Official City of Melbourne data visualisation

## Visualisation

With this project, we want to improve the way we visualise Melbourne's pedestrian activity

## Visualisation: different methods

## Visualisation: importance of design

As we can see, there are many different ways to present the same data  

When designing visualisations for pedestrian data, we need to take into consideration:
- Preattentive processing
- Change blindness

Need to communicate the intended message to the person viewing the plots

## Interactive Visualisation: Shiny apps

The package `shiny` allows us to build web apps using R's capabilities in the background  

We can add interactive inputs to visualisations

#### An example of what we can make:

# Research Plan

### The plan to approach this research project is as follows:

1. Imputation that incorporates time and space
2. Creating a predictive model for each sensor
3. Investigation of visual methods for space-time counts
4. Development of a Shiny app: interface design, computation and data backend
5. Generation of a dynamic spatial model (if time permits)
